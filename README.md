# JavaScript Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: division by zero.  The `bug.js` file contains a function that can produce this error.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

The original code lacks proper error handling for division by zero.  The solution incorporates a check to avoid this error.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in JavaScript to prevent unexpected behavior and crashes.
